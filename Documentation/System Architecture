The RMHC to FHIR migration system consists of four main components:

1. **Dockerized HAPI FHIR Server**  
   - Hosts the FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Practitioner).  
   - Provides REST API endpoints to create, read, and update FHIR resources.  

2. **Translator (Python Script)**  
   - Reads the RMHC CSV data.  
   - Maps CSV columns to FHIR resource fields using Source-to-Target Mapping.  
   - Assigns UUIDs and generates FHIR-compliant JSON.

3. **Rulebook (FSH + SUSHI)**  
   - Defines FHIR profiles and StructureDefinitions for Patient, Practitioner, Observation.  
   - Ensures standardized resources across all implementations.

4. **Transaction Bundles**  
   - Groups multiple resources for atomic creation in the FHIR server.  
   - Ensures that either all resources are created or none, preserving data integrity.
